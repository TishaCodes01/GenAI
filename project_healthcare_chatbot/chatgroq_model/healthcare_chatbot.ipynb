      "There are several medications available to help manage high cholesterol levels. These medications can be broadly classified into the following categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Statins**: These are the most commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications. They work by inhibiting the production of cholesterol in the liver. Examples of statins include:\n",
      "\t* Atorvastatin (Lipitor)\n",
      "\t* Simvastatin (Zocor)\n",
      "\t* Rosuvastatin (Crestor)\n",
      "\t* Pravastatin (Pravachol)\n",
      "\t* Lovastatin (Mevacor)\n",
      "2. **Bile Acid Sequestrants**: These medications work by binding to bile acids in the intestines and removing them from the body, which helps to lower cholesterol levels. Examples include:\n",
      "\t* Cholestyramine (Questran)\n",
      "\t* Colestipol (Colestid)\n",
      "\t* Colesevelam (WelChol)\n",
      "3. **Fibrates**: These medications help to lower triglyceride levels and raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels. Examples include:\n",
      "\t* Fenofibrate (Tricor)\n",
      "\t* Gemfibrozil (Lopid)\n",
      "4. **Niacin**: This medication helps to raise HDL cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. However, it can have side effects such as flushing and liver damage.\n",
      "5. **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: These are newer medications that help to lower LDL cholesterol levels by blocking the action of a protein called PCSK9. Examples include:\n",
      "\t* Alirocumab (Praluent)\n",
      "\t* Evolocumab (Repatha)\n",
      "6. **Ezetimibe**: This medication helps to lower LDL cholesterol levels by blocking the absorption of cholesterol from the intestines.\n",
      "7. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: These medications help to lower triglyceride levels and may also help to raise HDL cholesterol levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's essential to note that medication should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as they can have side effects and interact with other medications. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management are also crucial in managing high cholesterol levels.\n",
